## 2. Tender Aspect — Roles & Permissions

### Admin

- **Post, Delete, Update** tenders (on behalf of clients / organizations).
- **What is posted:** Date of issue, deadline, documents (similar to Nest).

### Organizations

- **Organizations** can post their own tenders (company admins / agency admins).

### Tenders visibility

- Tenders can be **opened** (created/edited) by **admin** (staff) and **company admins** (users who are owner or admin of at least one company). The API enforces this: others get 403 on create/update. See [API.md](API.md) and [FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md](FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md).

### Tender submission steps (for bidder)

2. **Sign** (e.g. agreement / declaration).
3. **See progress** (track submission status).

## 4. Bid Security (formerly “Bid bond”)

**Two types:**

1. **Tender Security** — amount **or** percentage (stored: `tender_security_amount`, `tender_security_percentage`, `tender_security_currency`).
2. **Tender Securing Declaration** — provided as a **document** (no cash amount).

Model: `Tender.tender_securing_type`, `tender_security_percentage`, `tender_security_amount`, `tender_security_currency`.

## 5. Bids — Status & Terminology

- **Submission** → status **submitted** (no “review” as a status).
- **Evaluation** → use **under_evaluation** (not “review”).
- **Audit** → use **BidAuditLog** (audit trail); “review” in UI/API should read as “audit” where appropriate.

Status flow: **draft → submitted → under_evaluation → accepted / rejected**.

## 6. Tenders — Data & Rules

- **Categories**: Tender **category** and **subcategory** (type and subcategory).
- **Tender participation fee**: In **TZS** or **USD** (field: `tender_fees`, `currency`).
